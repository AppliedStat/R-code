* Example1.r   : R file for Example 1 in the paper
* Example1.rout: Output after running Example1.r 

* Example2.r   : R file for Example 2 in the paper
* Example2.rout: Output after running Example2.r 




The following might be convenient for Linux/Unix users.

% R --slave --no-save < Example1.r > Example1.rout 
% more Example1.rout
